# SarahSaysBot Demo

This is a minimalistic chat bot built using Microsoft Bot Framework and LUIS. 

[LUIS](https://luis.ai) provides simple Machine Learning tools to build your own language models (intents/entities) which allow any bot to understand your commands and act accordingly. "SarahSaysBot" uses a very simple LUIS model built to respond to greetings and farewells:
